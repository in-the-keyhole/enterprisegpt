# EnterpriseGPT
EnterpriseGPT is an open-source web application built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3.5. It's designed for enterprise IT organizations who wish to utilize the AI model while ensuring their source code isn't submitted for analysis. This is achieved through a custom filtering mechanism within the application.

EnterpriseGPT is dockerized for easy deployment and is built using Vite with React and TypeScript for the client and Node.js Express for the API.
